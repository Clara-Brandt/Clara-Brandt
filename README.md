I'm interested in this course because I don't have much in-depth experience with semantics, but I just finished Syntax which also focused heavily on structures so I want to learn more about what methods exist to represent semantic structures as well. I'm currently in my second year of the CLMS program, and am working on finding an internship for the final capstone project! In computational linguistics, I'm especially interested in corpus linguistics and language acquisition. My favorite thing about linguistics is attempting to formalize aspects of a psychological process that is not always clearly observable. In my free time, I like to read (especially science fiction!), I dabble in creative writing, and enjoy skiing and hiking.
